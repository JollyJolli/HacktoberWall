## 🚀 How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository** 🍴: Make a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Branch** 🌱: Set up a new branch for your contribution:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```
	3.	Make Changes ✍️: Modify the code as you like! For general contributions, follow the guidelines below. If you’re adding your name, just edit the contributors.json file.
	4.	Minify CSS and JS ⚡: To ensure optimal performance, minify your CSS and JS files before submitting them:
	•	For CSS, use tools like cssnano or online compressors.
	•	For JS, use UglifyJS or similar tools.
	5.	Add Comments 📝: Add explanatory comments to your code (use // in JavaScript and /* */ in CSS) to help others understand your logic and decision-making.
	6.	Commit Your Changes 💾: Use the commitlint format to create well-structured commit messages. Example:

git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with navbar layout"

Commit message format:
	•	feat: A new feature
	•	fix: A bug fix
	•	docs: Documentation only changes
	•	style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
	•	refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
	•	perf: Code change that improves performance

	7.	Submit a Pull Request 📬: Head over to your repository on GitHub and submit a pull request, describing your changes.

🛠️ Code Style

	•	Maintain a consistent code style throughout the project.
	•	Ensure your code is clean, well-structured, and well-documented. Use comments to clarify complex sections of the code.
